# Docker Development Rules

## Container Best Practices
- Minimize image layers
- Use specific versions for dependencies
- Keep entrypoint.sh idempotent
- Test changes with both unit and integration tests

## Image Architecture
- Base: Python 3.12 slim
- Includes: Node.js, zsh, git
- Entrypoint installs GAIA from PyPI at runtime
- Uses uv for 10-100x faster Python package installation

## Multi-Instance Support
The container is designed to spawn multiple instances:
- Use environment variables to customize each instance
- Different ports for LEMONADE, GAIA_API, and WEB
- Different container names for parallel development

## Volume Management
- `/source`: Working directory
- `/host`: Optional host directory mount for file exchange

## Performance
- First install: ~2-3 minutes
- Reinstall with cache: ~30 seconds
